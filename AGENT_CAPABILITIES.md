# Agent Capabilities & Task Examples

## Overview
Each agent in the naiborhood platform can execute autonomous tasks, generate real outputs (files, reports, documents), and provide tangible results - not just text responses.

## How It Works

### Autonomous Mode
When autonomous mode is enabled (ON by default), agents can:
1. **Detect task intent** from your natural language requests
2. **Execute multi-step processes** independently
3. **Generate downloadable files** (PDF, Excel, Word, CSV)
4. **Show progress updates** in real-time
5. **Notify you when complete** with actionable outputs

### Example Workflow
```
You: "Generate a monthly financial report"
Agent: 
  ✓ Analyzing request...
  ✓ Gathering financial data...
  ✓ Generating report...
  ✓ Task completed!
  
  📄 Monthly Financial Report (Excel)
  [Download Button]
