# ProtocolLM - Sales Overview

## The Elevator Pitch

**ProtocolLM is a plug-and-play compliance API that businesses connect to their existing workflows** (photos, checklists, documents) and get instant compliance decisions back. No developers required.

**Think**: Stripe for compliance checking instead of payments.

---

## Why These 5 Sectors?

We picked sectors where:
- ✅ Compliance is **mandatory** (not optional)
- ✅ Inspections are **frequent and stressful**
- ✅ Violations have **real consequences** (fines, closure, lawsuits)
- ✅ Tech competition is **low** (not crowded)
- ✅ Standards are **nationwide** (FDA, CMS, HUD - not state-by-state)

## Sales Objections & Answers

**"We already have a system"**
→ Great! ProtocolLM plugs into your existing system. Keep using what you have, we just add compliance checking.

**"We can't afford another subscription"**
→ One failed inspection costs more than a year of ProtocolLM. This pays for itself the first time it catches a violation.

**"Our staff won't use it"**
→ Your staff doesn't have to do anything different. They're already taking photos/checklists - we just analyze them automatically.

**"What if it's wrong?"**
→ We provide confidence scores and reference the specific regulation. You're still in control of decisions.

**"We need to see it work first"**
→ Free tier: 100 inspections/month. Try it for 30 days at no cost.
